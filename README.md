# read-the-time.zsh

The ultimate time-setting utility with which your Mac will read the time - so you can set other "dumb" clocks around you.

This script is (at least I think it is) the ultimate clock-setting
utility. It reads the time aloud from your Mac, with resolution to the
second. The vocalized time includes AM/PM, hour, and minute at the
appropriate times.

I use this script at _least_ twice a year when we do the quaint 19th century
tradition of setting clocks forward/back one hour. (I really hate it!)

Note: this script assumes the computer on which you are running this script
is synchronized via NTP or some other (is there any other??) time standard.

Also note: I wrote this in zsh because I like zsh.  :-)
You can probably port this to work under bash easily, but I'm not interested
in doing that myself - at least not right now. (Most Mac OS machines include
zsh anyway.)
